                    Professional networking, such as cold emails, coffee chats, etc oftentimes feel shallow, resulting
                    in very transactional relationships.
                    <br><br>
                    79% of professionals think networking is crucial, yet less than 38% stay in touch with their
                    network.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>So...</strong> How might we foster genuine professional relationships through mutual
                    connections for young
                    professionals?

                            It was a challenge to visualize how one's network could look like while also being inuitive enough to navigate around the space. It might be interesting to see how a peron with a lot more connections would look like. While designing, the mutual referral system was something we thought was a great feature, but through user testing we realized that it was more of a hassle.
                            <br><br>
                            Overall, I think that this is an extremely valid problem, as networking is very important in finding opportunities, but cold emailing and contacting can feel ingenuine. This was our way of tackling this issue, but it may be interesting to think of how else to go about it.
