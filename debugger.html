                    I participated in the GMTK (Game Maker’s Tool kit) 2023 Game Jam with a few of my friends to create
                    a fully functioning game from 0 to 100 within 48 hours.
                    <br /><br />
                    With the prompt of “Roles Reversed” we liked the idea of the player being the one working on the
                    game, instead of playing it. So, instead of playing through the game as the protagonist, players
                    have to take on the role of the developer, and squash bugs instead of enemies.

                        The moment we got the prompt “Roles Reversed”, we started to list out various ideas to ideate
                        on.<br /><br />

                        We eventually chose a theme where the player “plays” as a game developer, and has to “fix” our
                        bad
                        game.

                    For the world, we wanted to make it look like it was still “in progress” while being a complete
                    game. We took inspiration from games like Superhot, along with black and white volumetric sketches
                    of buildings.

                    For errors, we used familiar “no texture” textures to convey that something was glitching.

                    To really immerse the player , we added text notification and chat UI to make it seem like they are
                    communicating with the rest of the game making team.

                    After some workshopping on the story, we decide that the player would be helping us (the team making
                    this game) to fix bugs in time for us to submit for this game jam (pretty meta.. I know).
                    <br /><br />
                    The game starts off with a cut scene with messages from us saying we need help, then by exploring
                    the map, the player collects items that help them “fix” the level and help us complete the game in
                    time for submission.

                    Scoping was a big issue. We kept having fun ideas that we wanted to execute, but with only one
                    person programming and working on unity, it was difficult to balance fun ideas and realistic
                    expectations. It was our first game jam as a team, so understanding each of our abilities and limits
                    would help the next time we’re under a time crunch.
                    <br /><br />
                    Overall, it was a very fun experience to make a complete working game within 48 hours.
